# Enhancing-Robotic-Task-Performance-with-Reinforcement-Learning-and-Explainable-AI


## Overview

This repository presents a project that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Explainable AI (XAI) to optimize robotic task performance. The project utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm within the Gymnasium-Robotics library to train a model in the CartPole environment, a classic control problem. By integrating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), the project also ensures transparency in the model's decision-making process, enhancing trust and interpretability.

## Problem Statement

In dynamic and unpredictable environments, robots must navigate complex settings, necessitating adaptive and robust learning strategies for efficient and accurate task execution. This project aims to:

- **Objective**: Develop and evaluate a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to optimize robotic task performance in dynamic environments.
- **Goal**: Leverage the Gymnasium-Robotics library, implement a cutting-edge RL algorithm using Stable-Baselines3, and integrate Explainable AI techniques to improve transparency and demystify the model’s decision-making process.

## Project Significance

Robots are increasingly used in complex environments where precision and adaptability are critical. By combining RL with XAI, this project not only improves the performance of robotic tasks but also builds trust in AI systems by making their decisions transparent and understandable.

## Model Development

### Environment Configuration

- **Gymnasium-Robotics Library**: Utilized the CartPole environment, where the task involves balancing a pole on a cart by applying forces to the cart.
- **Task Objective**: The RL agent receives observations (such as pole angle and cart position) and takes actions (moving the cart left or right) to maximize cumulative rewards.

### Algorithm Selection

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Chosen for its robustness and efficiency in handling various RL tasks, particularly in environments like CartPole with continuous and discrete action spaces.

### Training Process

- **Model Initialization**: Initialized the PPO model with MlpPolicy.
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Total timesteps: 10,000
  - Learning rate: 0.0003
  - Batch size: 64
  - Epochs: 10
- **Training Execution**: The model was trained over 10,000 timesteps, monitoring performance metrics such as episode length mean and reward mean.

## Evaluation and Results

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix analysis.
  - The model demonstrated consistent performance, achieving an average reward of 375.5 over 10 episodes, showcasing its effectiveness in balancing the pole.

### Explainability with SHAP

- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**:
  - SHAP values were computed to interpret the model’s predictions, providing insights into the influence of each feature on the model’s actions.
  - Implemented by sampling observations from the CartPole environment to create a background dataset and using SHAP KernelExplainer with the PPO model.
  - The generated SHAP values highlighted feature importance, making the model’s decision-making process transparent and interpretable.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: Implemented strict data privacy measures, anonymizing all data used in the project.
- **Bias Analysis**: Conducted thorough bias analyses to ensure the dataset was fair and representative.
- **Transparency**: Detailed documentation of every project phase was maintained to enhance credibility and facilitate peer review, ensuring that the RL model is both effective and trustworthy.

## Conclusion

### Key Insights

- **Synergy of RL and XAI**: Combining Reinforcement Learning with Explainable AI offers a powerful approach that enhances robotic task performance while building trust through transparency.
- **Model Performance**: The PPO model showcased exceptional performance in the CartPole task, consistently achieving high rewards and demonstrating robust learning capabilities.

### Lessons Learned

- **Data Quality**: High-quality, representative data is crucial for training effective and reliable AI models.
- **Model Transparency**: Incorporating XAI techniques like SHAP enhances trust and understanding of model behavior, which is essential for practical applications.
- **Iterative Optimization**: Continuous tuning and validation are vital to achieving robust model performance.

This project not only optimized robotic task performance using RL but also set a new standard for effective and interpretable AI solutions in robotics by providing a transparent window into the model's behavior.
